1. Shared Account Dashboard

This dashboard assists members of households who are pooling their resources in an interest-earning savings account or similar. The dashboard allows up to five users per account and is initially designed for a period of 5 years, although this could be extended. It has three tabs: a tracking tab, a (hidden) calculations tab, and the dashboard itself. 

To use the dashboard, users simply enter their individual transactions (deposit or withdrawal) in the tracking tab and any monthly or annual interest received for the total account. This information is then used to populate a table on the calculations tab and assign the interest based on the proportions of each user's contribution, calculated on a monthly basis.

The result is a visual overview of the shared account.
